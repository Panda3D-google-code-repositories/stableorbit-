iterative evolution is working awesome, execute the GA with

./python2.5 GA.py

be sure your data directory is empty before you start

if you want to see what a system looks like before and after being evolved for 100 iterations, run:

./python2.5 monte_planet.py

on line 195 uncomment the system you would like to see

#set_conditions('dataold/data/mark-100sys-9/') #after 100 dt intervals	
set_conditions('dataold/data/mark-0sys-9/')	#same system after 0
